# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

This project is for Jeff Choate's Udacity AWS Developer Nanodegree project for image filtering on Elastic Beanstalk.

The code from here should run a local instance via 'npm run dev'

The code here is also deployed to http://choateimagefilter-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

There is an image of the Elastic Beanstalk deployment in this git repo as well.

#Issues

I ran into issues with the npm run build command erroring out and I could not figure out why.  I ran the individual commands from the build script and they seemed to work alright.

This allowed me to run the eb init, eb create, and eb deploy commands.
